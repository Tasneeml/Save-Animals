                in a day many of animals killed some killed by hunters, some killed by accidents. what will happen if
                all the animals killed? is animals give us food? yes animals give us foods like milk, eggs, meat, etc...
                if all the animals were killed than we will not get any food which have a lot of nutritions, proteins,
                etc.....

                there are soo many types of animals like lion, tigers, eleplants, cow+, hen, goat, etc. hunters kill
                eleplant for eleplant teeth.. by tiger skin they decorate their home. goat and cow give us milk and
                meat. and with the help of animal skin we get ladder things like ladders shoes, belt, etc.... with snake
                poison skin use to make belt. hen give us eggs.
